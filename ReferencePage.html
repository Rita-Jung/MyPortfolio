      <p>Positive reinforcement training is all about utilizing things which motivate our dogs in order to both teach them new skills, and maintain the skills they already have. Treats are the most common and well-known motivator used in dog training, however, effective positive reinforcment training utilizes much more than treats.</p>
      <p>Some people think you can't get a dog to stop an unwanted behavior without the use of corrections, however, this could not be further from the truth.</p>

    <header>Core Fundamentals</header>
    <p>One of the most important core fundatmentals of positive reinforcement training is: behavior which is rewarded will be repeated. This means that when we are teaching our dogs new skills, it's crucial that we start to build a strong history of reinforcement associated with the behavior; the more often we reward our dogs for sitting, the more often they will repeat the behavior.</p>
    <p>This is also where getting unwanted behaviors to cease comes into play: if our dogs are peristing in a certain behavior, it is certainly being reinforced in some aspect. Sometimes it is us humans who are unintentionally rewarding it, and sometimes the behavior itself is reinforcing to the dog. Finding where the behavior is being rewarded and taking away the reinforcing aspect of the behavior is key to getting our dogs to cease in their unwanted behaviors.</p>
    <p>A classic example is counter-surfing. This is most often a behavior which the human is not rewarding at all, but rather the dog keeps finding tasty snacks on the counter and thus finds reinforcement from counter-surfing. Making sure that the counters are completely free from anything the dog might want to grab will eventually result in the dog ceasing the behavior simply because it becomes a waste of their time.</p>

    <header>Classical Conditioning</header>
    <p>Classical conditioning, also known as Pavlov Theory, is something most people are already familiar with. The well-known experiment conducted by Pavlov himself (ringing a bell before meal-time, eventually resulting in a salivary response) is the same thing we use to train our dogs. This is where a "marker" becomes relevant: a marker is associated with a treat, thus over time the dog learns that when you say "yes" it means they are about to get a treat. Markers are very useful because they allow us to "mark" a behavior in the instant the dog performs it. If we are, for example, teaching a dog to sit for the first time, it's likely that they will sit and then get back up a second later. If we use a marker such as "yes" we can mark that sit before the dog gets back up again, and then follow it up with a treat. If we did not use a marker and simply used a treat, we would most likely not time it right, resulting in us rewarding the dog for getting back up again.</p>

    <header>Operant Conditioning</header>
    <p>Operant conditioning (OC) is mostly a fancy term for training theory. OC can be applied not just to dogs, but to animals of any variety, humans included. In fact, OC is the theory which is applied when raising/teaching children. 
	OC can be broken up into four categories: Positive Reinforcement, Negative Reinforcement, Positive Punishment, and Negative Punishment. To explain what these actually mean, we need to first define some terms.</p>
	
<p><ul>
  <li>Reinforcement:
	To increase a behavior</li>
	<li>Punishment: 
	To decrease a behavior</li>
	<li>Positive:
	To add a stimulus</li>
	<li>Negative:
	To remove a stimulus</li>
	<li>Extinction:
	To stop all reinforcement of a 
behavior until it goes into extinction</li></p>
